The recursive algorithm finds all subsets of the array with
size 2 and checks if this subset sums up to k. Because of
this, the running time of the algorithm should be a number
of 2-sized subsets of the array of length n, which equals
to "n choose 2" = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!) = n * (n - 1) / 2 =
= O(n^2). So the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2)
